    request:
      title: Account deletion and reset
      info: If you can't access your account through the security options you set
        up previously, deleting your account and creating a new one is the only option.
        <br><br> We can't undo an account delete, so please make sure you don't have
        another security option you can use instead like your personal key.
      personal_key: Do you have your personal key?
      personal_key_info: Your personal key is a 16 character code that was given to
        you at account creation as a recovery method--see example below.
      personal_key_trailer: If you have your personal key, you can use it to %{link}
        instead of resetting.
      access_your_account: access your account
      delete_account: Delete your account
      delete_account_info: Deleting your existing account and creating a new one will
        allow you to use the same email address and set up new security options.  However,
        deleting will remove any agency applications you have linked to your account
        and you will need to restore each connection. <br><br> If you continue, you
        will first receive an email confirmation.  As a security measure, you will
        receive another email with the link to continue deleting your account 24 hours
        after the initial confirmation email arrives.
      are_you_sure: Are you sure you don't have access to any of your security methods
        OR your personal key?
      no_cancel: No, cancel
      yes_continue: Yes, continue deletion.
    confirm_request:
      check_your_email: Check your email
      instructions: We sent an email to <strong>%{email}</strong> to begin the account
        delete process. Follow the instructions in your email to complete the process.
        <br><br> As a security measure, we also sent a text to your registered phone
        number. <br><br> You can close this window if you are done.
    delete_account:
      title: Deleting your account should be your last resort
      info: Deleting your account should be your last resort if you are locked out
        of your account. You will not be able to recover any information linked to
        your account.  Once your account is deleted, you can create a new one using
        the same email address.
      are_you_sure: Are you sure you want to delete your account?
      delete_button: Delete account
      cancel: Cancel
    confirm_delete_account:
      title: You have deleted your account
      info: The account for <strong>%{email}</strong> has been deleted. We sent an
        email confirmation of the account deletion. <br><br> You may %{link} or close
        this window if you're done.
