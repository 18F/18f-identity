        question_1: What is %{app}?
        answer_1: >
          %{app} offers the public secure and private online access to
          participating government programs. With one %{app} account, users can
          sign in to multiple government agencies. The goal: make managing
          federal benefits, services and applications faster and more secure.
        answer_2_html: >
          The %{general_services_administration_link}, or GSA, manages %{app}.
          As a federal agency, GSA’s mission is to make interactions with the
          government easier and more efficient.

        title: Creating an account
        question_1: How do I create an account with %{app}?
        answer_1:
          answer: >
            To create a %{app} account, you will need: a valid email address,
            and a working phone number. We will also ask you to create a
            password.
          heading_1: Enter your email and confirm it
          part_1: >
            Select “create an account” and enter your email address where
            indicated. Then check your email account for a message from us. Within
            the email is a link. Clicking the link will send you back to %{app}
            with your email confirmed.
          heading_2: Enter your password
          part_2: >
            Next, you will create a strong password. Use the password strength
            meter on the screen as a guide. Passwords must be at least 8
            characters, but otherwise there are no restrictions. You can even
            enter spaces in between words to get to 8 characters.
          heading_3: Enter your phone number and confirm it
          part_3:
            step_1: >
              Next, you will enter a phone number at which you can get calls or SMS
              messages. If you have a landline, please ask for a security code by a
              phone call. We will send a unique security code to that phone number
              each time you sign into your account. This is called two-step
              authentication. The second step keeps your account more secure than
              using only a password.
            step_2: >
              Each security code expires after 5 minutes and can only be used once.
              If you don’t enter the security code within 5 minutes, just request a
              new code. Each code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve
              already used.
            step_3: >
              Type the security code into the field. That’s it! You have just taken
              an important step to keep yourself and your government safe. Every
              time you sign back into your %{app} account, you will receive a new
              security code that you need to enter. You’ll get the option each time
              you sign in to get a security code by a phone call or by SMS.
          heading_4: Save your personal key
          part_4: >
            After you’ve created your account, you will get a personal key, which
            is a set of 16 randomly generated letters. Make a note of them and
            store the note separately from your phone. If you forget your password
            or don't have your phone, you can enter the personal key to access
            your services or applications.
        question_2: What is two-step authentication?
        answer_2: >
          %{app} uses two-step authentication to keep accounts secure. As its
          name implies, two-step authentication (sometimes called two-factor
          authentication, or 2FA), requires two different methods to sign into
          an account. Usually this means entering a memorized password and a
          unique code sent to a device (such as a phone) that you own. Requiring
          two methods makes breaking into your account much harder.
        question_3: >
          Why do I need to confirm my email address and my phone number?
        answer_3: >
          %{app} uses your email address and phone number to send important
          security messages about account activity. We won’t use them for any
          other purposes, and we won’t share them with anyone without your
          express permission.
        question_4: I didn’t receive a confirmation email from %{app}.
        answer_4:
          answer: >
            If you didn’t receive a confirmation email, check your spam filter.
            Alternatively, you may have accidentally mistyped your email address.
            If so, you can always make another account with your correct email
            address.
          part_1_html: >
            If you mistyped your address, you can %{create_a_new_account_link}.
          create_a_new_account_link: create a new account
          part_2: >
            If you are certain you entered the correct address, choose
            “Send again” to get a new confirmation email.
        question_5: Why didn’t I receive a security code to confirm my phone?
        answer_5:
          answer: >
            If you didn’t receive a security code, check whether you entered your
            phone number correctly.
          part_1_html: >
            If you entered the wrong phone number, you can
            %{update_phone_number_link}.
          update_phone_number_link: update your phone number here
          part_2_html: >
            If you entered your phone number correctly, you can
            %{resend_confirmation_link}. Select if you want to receive the
            security code by text message if you have a mobile phone or through a
            phone call if you have either a landline or a mobile phone.
          resend_confirmation_link: resend the confirmation SMS
        question_6: Do I need a mobile phone to use %{app}?
        answer_6: >
          You do not need to own a mobile phone to use %{app}. You do need to
          provide a phone number – either a landline or a mobile phone – at
          which you can receive security codes every time you sign in either by
          SMS or phone call.
        question_7: >
          Why do I need to use %{app} to access government services online?
        answer_7:
          part_1: >
            Government agencies decide for themselves how they want to interact
            with the public. You were sent to %{app} because the service or
            program you want to use has chosen to take advantage of the efficiency
            and security of %{app} as a shared technology platform. Once you have
            finished at %{app}, you will be directed back to the agency.
          part_2: >
            We hope %{app} is a convenient and secure option for you. However, if
            you prefer not to use %{app}, you can always access government
            services. You’ll find more information at your agency.
        question_8: >
          What do I do if an account already exists under my email address?
        answer_8:
          part_1: >
            Confirming access to an email address is the first step in making a
            %{app} account. If you received a notice that there is already a
            %{app} account associated with your email address but you don’t
            remember creating it, use your email address to sign in and go through
            the password reset process.
          part_2: >
            If you are not able to sign in or you have other questions about this,
            call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist between the
            hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except
            federal holidays.
          part_3: >
            Please notify %{app} if you are sure you did not create an account,
            and feel like someone else is using your email address.
        question_9: >
          What do I do if an account has already been created using my phone
          number?
        answer_9: >
          If you are not able to sign in or you have other questions about this,
          call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist between the

      signing_in:
        title: Signing in
        question_1: What do I need to have in order to sign in?
        answer_1: >
          Every time you log into your account, you will need your email
          address, your password, and access to your phone. After you have
          entered your email address and password, %{app} will send to your
          phone a security code, which you will need to enter into the security
          code field in order to be logged in securely.
        question_2: What do I do if my password doesn’t work or I forget it?
        answer_2:
          part_1: >
            If you don’t know your password, the link to reset it is on the
            sign-in page. Enter your email address to receive  a link to reset
            your password. Once you follow the link, you’ll be asked to enter a
            new password.  Reconfirm that you have your phone (the one you will
            use to receive one-time passcodes).
          part_2: >
            After you’ve successfully signed into %{app} after resetting your
            password, %{app} will give you a personal key. The personal key is to
            be used in the event you forget your password or don't have your phone
            with you. Make a note of it and store it separately from your phone.
        question_3: >
          What happens if I miss the phone call or the text message with my
          one-time security code?
        answer_3: >
          Every time you sign in you will need to enter a security code that is
          sent to your phone either by text message or by phone call. The
          security code you receive expires after 5 minutes and can only be used
          once. If you miss entering the security code within the 5 minutes or
          you just missed the phone call, just request a new security code. Each
          security code is only good once, so no one can steal one you’ve
          already used. We limit requests to three every 15 minutes, but
          otherwise you can request as many codes as you need.
        question_4: If I don’t have my phone with me, can I still sign in?
        answer_4:
          part_1: >
            It is necessary to have your phone in order to get the security key to
            sign in. But if you don’t have your phone with you, you will need the
            personal key you received when you created your account. Enter the
            personal key when instructed and select submit. Once you are signed
            in, you will immediately get a new personal key. Please store the
            personal key in a safe place separately from your phone since the
            personal key will let you sign in to your account in case you don’t
            have your phone with you.
          part_2: >
            We encourage you to store your personal key somewhere other than your
            computer or mobile device — this way, you’ll be able to access your
            personal key even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are
            hacked.
        question_5: >
          I can’t remember where my personal key is and I don’t have my phone
          with me.
        answer_5:
          part_1: >
            If you don’t have your phone or your personal key, you may need to
            create a new account and re-verify your personal information. To
            create a new account, you will need to use a different email address
            than you did when you created your first account. For urgent matters
            — for example, to check the status of an in-progress application —
            you may want to directly contact the government agency.
          part_2: >
            Or, if you don’t have your personal key and phone, call 1-844-USLOGIN
            to talk to an information specialist between the hours of 8 a.m. and
            8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except federal holidays.
          part_3: >
            Another option is to log in at a later time when you have your phone
            near you.
        question_6: Why does the system log me out?
        answer_6:
          part_1: >
            When a user is already signed in, and they want to change their email,
            password, or phone number, they must enter their current password
            first. After three incorrect guesses, the user is signed out.
          part_2: >
            The system also logs you out if you entered the security code that was
            sent to your phone, incorrectly 3 times. Failed attempts are limited
            to three per session, followed by a 5-minute lockout.
        question_7: I forgot which email address I used to create an account.
        answer_7:
          part_1: >
            If you can’t remember which email address you used to create your
            account, you can use the password reset function to see if your email
            address is on file.
          part_2: >
            Try to sign in as usual and ask to have your password reset. Then,
            enter the email address you believe you used to create your account.
            If we have your email address in our records, we will send
            instructions on how to reset your password. Check your email in a few
            minutes for these instructions.
          part_3: >
            If still can’t remember the email address you used to set up your
            account, call 1-844-USLOGIN to talk to an information specialist
            between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through
            Friday, except federal holidays.

        title: Changing settings
        question_1: How do I change my password?
        answer_1:
          part_1_html: >
            To change your password, sign in at %{app} and go to your Profile
            page. If you want to change your password, select Edit next to
            password, enter the new password and submit your change. Passwords
            must be at least 8 characters but otherwise there are no restrictions.
            You can even use more than one word with spaces to get to 8
            characters.
          part_2: >
            Instead, try making a long and complex password by using a phrase or a
            series of words that only you recognize. And please make it different
            than any other passwords you use to sign into other accounts such as
            your bank account or email. Using the same passwords for your email,
            financial and social media accounts makes identity theft easier.
        question_2: How do I change my email address?
        answer_2: >
          To change your email address, select Edit next to the email address.
          Enter the new email address and submit it. Then check your email
          account and look for an email from %{app}. Open the email and click on
          the link provided. Clicking the link will redirect you back to %{app}.
          Once you reach %{app} your new email address is established.
        question_3: How do I change the phone number I am using with my account?
        answer_3: >
          To change the phone number where you get your security code, select
          Edit next to the phone number and enter the new phone number. %{app}
          will immediately send your security code to confirm the new phone
          number.

            %{app} respects your privacy. We collect personal data online only to
            help you fulfill your requests with federal agencies that partner with

            bound by our privacy policy. %{app} does not lease, sell or release
            your personal information to private companies, contractors, or
            vendors for marketing purposes.
          part_2: >
            %{app} links to external federal government sites for services

        question_3: How do I make my password strong?
        answer_3:
          part_1: >
            Your password should be at least 8 characters long. Try using multiple
            words and spaces to create a memorable phrase. Longer passwords with
            many words are stronger than short passwords with special characters.
          part_2: >
            When creating a password, also try to avoid using slang terms and
            common misspellings and words spelled backward. Also, avoid using your
            company name or your spouse’s or children’s names - and even your pet
            - as well as other personal information such as your age or birth
            date.

          part_4: >
            But, if you repeatedly enter an incorrect password, it is most likely
            due to a malicious person taking over your machine that you left

            If you accidentally saved your %{app} password or other sign-in
