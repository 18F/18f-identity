        Login.gov uses a variety of industry-standard security methods to
        protect this U.S. government service and your data, and to ensure the

      paragraph_3: >
        Unauthorized access or use of login.gov (e.g. use for criminal purposes,

      paragraph_5: >
        Our goal is to protect your personal information, and we will not share
        it without your permission.  For example, we will ask you before sharing

        services. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where we are
        required to share data for law enforcement purposes.
