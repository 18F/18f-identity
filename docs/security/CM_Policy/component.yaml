        Agency Configuration Management Policy
        The GSA CM policy is defined in the GSA IT Security Policy (CIO P 2100.1), which addresses purpose, scope, roles,
        responsibilities, and compliance for CM activities.
        The DHS Office of the CISO is responsible for publishing the above documents to System Program Managers and Information
        System Security Officers and Managers (ISSO/Ms) on a centralized, agency-accessible website.
        CM procedures are documented in the GSA IT Security Procedural Guide: Managing Enterprise Risks (CIO IT Security-06-30).
        The 18F Program Office develops, documents, and disseminates to all 18F staff
        The 18F configuration management policy which addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment,
        coordination among organizational entities, and compliance and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
        configuration management policy and associated configuration controls. The 18F security assessment and authorization
        policy is listed within its private GitHub repository https://github.com/18F/compliance-docs/blob/master/CM-Policy.md
        that is accessible to all 18F staff.

        The DHS Office of the CISO is responsible for reviewing and updating the above documents annually, and notifying
        System Program Managers and Information System Security Officers and Managers (ISSO/Ms).
        The 18F Program Office will review and update the current 18F configuration management policy at least every 3 years
        and any documented configuration procedures at least annually.

        For AWS Baseline Configurations:
        AWS Cloud Formation templates, CIS Level 1 benchmarks and any GSA/18F benchmarks such as hardening guidelines
        and baselines are the approved baseline for all changes to the infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management
        on AWS. They provide an automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against an approved
        baseline.
        Windows and Linux instances are based on the standard AWS AMI images in accordance with DHS configuration requirements.

        Note: Additional OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance may also be used whenever appropriate. It is
        understood that when industry standards are adopted they may need to be adapted for the specific implementation
        and if/where this has occurred it should be mentioned/referenced. 18F ensures that the most current, relevant
        OS/Device-specific industry standards and guidance is maintained where appropriate to support Login.gov configurations.
        These best practice updates are captured during the annual review of the CM Policy which also incorporates 18 procedures.

        The 18F PMO must review baseline configuration changes at a minimum on an annual basis and on an as needed basis as

        The 18F PMO reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system when required by the DHS Authorizing Officals. Significant change may result from, but are not limited to, multiple required changes occurring simultaneously,
        changes that impact/modify security settings, and/or major component additions and/or upgrades.
        Such changes will go
        through the 18F CM Process, presented to the DHS assigned ISSO and if applicable, be submitted to the DHS for
        review, vetting acceptability and to ensure ongoing acceptance of security control implementation(s).

        Configuration management at the AWS level is managed through Terraform configuration files, AWS Config? and VisualOps?. 18F maintains baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and AMIs. Terraform configuration files help maintains a strict configuration management scheme of the Login.gov. Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure.
        For Login.gov, an operator initiates a new deployment using the Capistrano. Automated Configuration of Login.gov platform
        components is handled by the Travis.ci, a continuous integration and deployment tool which utilizes the Login.gov
        AWS FISMA hardened Ubuntu AMI.

        All Configuration Change control:
        Login.gov team provisions its infrastructure with Terraform configuration files. These
        tools use configuration files to describe the components to build with exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings.
        Because these files are text files, 18F can simply track differences in
        these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way
        developers control revisions to source code.
        Login.gov team uses version control systems to manage changes to Login.gov systems and to determine exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point Login.gov admin team needs to revert changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of a configuration templates.
        Login.gov team uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes
        within the infrastructure. Within GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast any changes made to configurations of Login.gov.

        Login.gov team uses the following methods to document configuration change decisions
        associated with its information systems.  For changes related to the its
        virtual infrastructure, Login.gov operator manages configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.
        All Login.gov configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked within 18F's GitHub site.  All configuration changes related to applications and websites hosted within the 18F AWS environment are requested by the systems owner and approved by Login.gov operators within the 18F GitHub tracking systems.

        18F posts its current inventory of information systems on its dashboard
        located at  https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/. Several sources are used to capture
        complete inventories of the virtual infrastructure and its information systems
        while providing the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.
        The AWS Management Console, and Github are used to provide additional enumeration capabilities.

        The 18F GitHub repository also is used to show a current lists of components that make up the Login.gov inventory [NEED TO DO]

        This includes all information system within the VPCs and components within the Login.gov platform as a service.

        Login.gov operators continuously maintains inventory of all instances and configuration.
        Login.gov operators review and update the information system component inventory
        on a monthly basis and updates the inventory of information system whenever installations, removals, and other changes are made. Login.gov operators will verify that all components within the authorized boundary of the information system are either inventoried as part of the system or recognized by another system as a component within that systems inventory.
