      Policy https://github.com/18f/compliance-docs/blob/master/SC-Policy.md

      Login.gov limits the effects of Volume Based and Protocol DoS type attacks by
      utilizing the following groups of technical measure:

      18F administrative staff maintains hardened Amazon Managed Images (AMI) and
      Cloud Foundry custom buildpacks with the lates patches and updates.
      A buildpacks provides framework and runtime support for an applications that
      are deployed on Login.gov.  The AMI and custome buildpacks are maintained
      and secured within 18F's software repository, Github.

      Login.gov also uses AWS's IaaS services with well formed Vitual Private Cloud (VPC)
      firewall rules to reduce the attack surface, while service resiliencey is maintained
      by utilizing AWS Avaliability zones, Elastic Load balancing and Autoscaling services.
      Suricata, a NIDS/IPS is used to detected as well as prevent attacks and anomolies
      based on threat signatures published on a regular basis.

      Cloud Foundry's security components limits the effects of an attack at the
      Application Layer. It limits DoS attacks on this layer through
      resource starvation and reduction of the attack surface even further with
      well formed application security groups which control the traffic flowing from
      hosted applications.

      These tools combined with SOC staffing are responsible for maintaining system
      security.

      CF Application Security Groups (ASGs) control the traffic flowing out of applications.
      Each cf application uses a dedicated Linux container, and each container includes a
      dedicated virtual network interface. Application security groups
      are a collection of ‘allow’ rules that can be made with global or application specific
      assignments enabling access to be set on individual application requirements.
      These requirements are added through whitelisting and whitelisting is layered on top
      of a series of container-centric lock-downs, allowing limited access to other applications
      and services.
