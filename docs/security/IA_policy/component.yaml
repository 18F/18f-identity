      Login.gov allows consumers to access user entitled resources with a combination of identity
      proofing and authentication. Identity proofing is done during account creation or recovery at IAA2 and periodically
      over time due to inactivity. It will use government approved (TSF) 3rd party identity verification services,
      where Login.gov system will interaction with said service for Identity verification and proceed with authentication
      services between the consumer and Service Provider. Authentication will be done using email address, password plus
      a 2nd Factor tools such as cellular phone service based SMS OTP or other emerging authenticators.

      Privileged users access to the system will be controlled through AWS IAM RBAC service.
